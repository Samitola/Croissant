    <h1>üçï Pizza</h1>
    <p>
      Pizza was first invented in Naples, Italy as a fast, affordable, tasty
      meal for working-class Neapolitans on the go. While we all know and love
      these slices of today, pizza actually didn't gain mass appeal until the
      1940s, when immigrating Italians brought their classic slices to the
      United States.
